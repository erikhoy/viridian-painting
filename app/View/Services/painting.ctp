    <p>Viridian Painting &amp; Property Services offers high-quality, interior and exterior painting. We will paint your entire house, one or more rooms, or you may even choose to hire us for a day. We paint using a brush-and-roller method, ensuring a longer lasting, higher quality paint job.</p>
    <p>Some of the services we offer:
      <ul>
        <li>Prepwork &mdash; Sanding, scraping, priming &amp; caulking</li>
        <li>Power washing</li>
        <li>Cabinet and furniture painting</li>
        <li>Crown molding, baseboards and trim</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>At Viridian, we use eco-friendly practices, part of which means that we use paints with low- or zero-VOCs. VOCs, or Volatile Organic Compounds, are chemicals that are added to most paints, and can adversely affect the respiratory system, and in some extreme cases, the central nervous system. </p>
    <p>Being eco-friendly also includes the methods of cleanup and disposal during and after a job. Using fabric drop cloths, we reduce the need for some cleanup, and the drop cloths can be reused. We reuse most of our buckets and cans, and what we donâ€™t, we recycle.</p>
    <p>We also choose to buy quality tools and products, and then take proper care of them. For instance, we buy quality brushes and clean them after the job in a bucket of water, instead of running water in the sink or a running hose.</p>
